# VS Code TypeScript Dev

[An extension for working in the TypeScript codebase.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-typescript-dev&ssr=false)

## Features

It's not too smart yet, but:

- it lets you choose a test file and re-run that file easily from anywhere in your editor.
- It adds syntax highlighting for .types and .symbol files in a way which won't fill your screen with errors.
